                            <h2>Coverage</h2>

                            <p>This privacy policy document is written for downloaders, namely those who download files through Maskbook plugin "File Service" at "Landing Pages", the webpages which display download options for such files. For uploaders, there is another document.</p>

                            <h2>Information Being Collected</h2>

                            <p>In this document, "this webpage" refers to the "Landing Page" instead of the privacy policy page.</p>
                            <p>This webpage is part of Maskbook File Service. This webpage is generated within the Maskbook software and is deployed on arbitrary web hosting services.</p>
                            <p>The developers of Maskbook does not collect any data of you as you view this webpage or download the file contained therein, unless you are viewing this webpage via the cache service provided by the developers of Maskbook, where your IP address may be recorded for anti-abuse purposes.</p>
                            <p>If you are viewing the webapge at *.arweave.net, the web traffic goes through the Arweave blockchain network and has totally no interaction with the developers of Maskbook.</p>
                            <p>By downloading, you are making interactions with the Arweave blockchain network, where the file is hosted. The nodes of the Arweave blockchain network might record your browser classification information and your IP address.</p>
                            <p>You may learn more about the privacy policy of Arweave at <a href="https://arweave.org/">arweave.org</a>.</p>
